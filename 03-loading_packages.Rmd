# Loading packages

```{r include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = F, message = F, error = F)
```
The first step in any analysis is the load the packages you will need for your analysis. Loading packages allows you to use powerful functions not included in "base" R.

For this analysis, you will use the tidyverse package, which actually loads a group of useful packages including `tidyr`, `dplyr`, `readr`, and `ggplot2`. `tidyr` and `dplyr` are very handy packages for manipulating data, `readr` is great for loading in data such as csv files, while `ggplot2` is one of the best packages from plotting data. `lubridate` is another very handy package for dealing with dates and times.

```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
library(lubridate) 
```
