["index.html", "An introduction to basic fisheries analysis with R 1 Objective", " An introduction to basic fisheries analysis with R 1 Objective The purpose of this guidebook is to provide an introduction to using the powerful programming language R to conduct analyses commonly used for fisheries management. The guidebook is designed to help you get quickly started in R with some basic analyses and visualizations, but it is only and introduction and is not exhaustive. We do however point to some helpful resources for learning more. R is a free programming language/software environment that allows users to analyze, model, and vizualize large data sets in much more powerful and complex ways than traditional spreadsheet programs like Excel or Google Sheets. Best of all, R is open source, meaning that it is freely available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and anyone can contribute to making R better. In fact, numerous R packages (more on these later) are specifically designed for conducting analyses related to fisheries management. RStudio is the powerful graphical interface that allows users to manage their code, data, and files all in one convenient program. If you are interested in learning more about data analysis with R, the free online book called R for Data Science is an excellent resource. "],

The objective of this guide is to provide an introduction to R/RStudio basics so that interested resource managers without programming experience can start leveraging R for their management decisions. R and RStudio are separate programs and that need to be installed and updated individually. If you do not keep both relatively up-to-date you will likely run into problems. 2.1 R To install R, go to the R webpage and follow the link to your operating system of choice (Linux, Max OS X, Windows). Then, click on the most recent .pkg file to download it. Follow the instructions to complete the installation process. 2.2 RStudio After installing R, visit the RStudio Products site and click the DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO DESKTOP button located partway down the page. Next, scroll to the bottom and click on the link under Installers that again corresponds to your operating system of choice. Save the file on your desktop. Once it finishes downloading, open the file and follow the instructions to complete the installation process. You may then delete the file. Congratulations! You successfully completed the installation process and are one step closer to using R and RStudio for analysis! 2.3 Helpful Resources Installing R and RStudio by Jenny Bryan "],
["getting-started-with-rstudio.html", "3 Getting Started with RStudio 3.1 RStudio Interface 3.2 Working Directory 3.3 Packages 3.4 Helpful Resources", " 3 Getting Started with RStudio Rstudio is what’s referred to as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the R programming language. It provides a single interface for an R user to manage all aspects of an analysis (write code, manage and plot data. see outputs, get help, etc.). 3.1 RStudio Interface There are four main panels in RStudio (Figure 1). Code Editor - This is where you write the code for your analysis. Each tab represents a different R script file (e.g. snapper_analysis.R) Console - This is where R prints the output of your code when it’s run. You can also write code directly in the console after the &gt; symbol Environment/History - This panel generally has the following two tabs: Environment - Displays all your data, variables, and user-defined functions. These are created by the user either in the code editor or directly in the console. History - A list of your command history Files/Packages/Help/Viewer - This panel contains numerous helpful panels: Files - The list of all files contained in your current working directory. You can also navigate to different folders on your computer. This is where you can click on different R scripts to open them in the code editor. Plots - When you produce plots with your code they will be displayed here Packages - The list of packages (groups of functions) currently installed on your computer. You can install new packages or update existing packages from this tab by clicking Install or Update. Help - Where you can search the R documentation to get help using the different R functions. This is a very useful feature of RStudio! You can also get help for a function by typing ? followed by the function name in the console (e.g. ?data.frame()). 3.2 Working Directory The working directory is an important concept in R (and programming in general) and refers to the current directory (folder) that you are working in. Basically, R requires that you tell it where in your computer’s file system it should start looking for files from. This is important because the code used to load data and save results and plots will differ depending on your current working directory. As an example, let’s imagine you are working on an analysis of coral reef fisheries and you have a folder on your Desktop called reef_fish. Inside this reef_fish directory is the file reef_fish_data.csv that you want to analyze. Open RStudio and click Set Working Directory... under the Session menu in the toolbar. This asks you to specify the folder on your computer that R should consider to be the working directory. 3.2.1 Pathnames (Path) Now that the working directory is set, you can load your reef fish data into RStudio by specifying the appropriate pathname to the file. In this case, the pathname is simply reef_fish_data.csv since the file is in the working directory and the data could be loaded with read.csv(file = &quot;reef_fish_data.csv&quot;). If, however, reef_fish_data.csv was actually stored in a subfolder called data the previous read.csv() command will not work because reef_fish_data.csv is not in the working directory. In this case, you can either tell R where the file is using the absolute, complete path (e.g. /Users/You/Desktop/reef_fish/data/reef_fish_data.csv), or with the path relative to the working directory (e.g. data/reef_fish_data.csv). 3.3 Packages Packages are groups of functions that are designed to excel at certain tasks (making plots, standardizing dates, reading/writing large data files, etc.). Many useful packages come standard with R when you download it, however, many more are available online. To install a new package, click on the “Install” button located under the “Packages” tab in RStudio. This will open a pop-up where you can search for and install R packages hosted on CRAN. Alternatively, if you know the name of the package you want to install, you can run install.packages('package_name'). Once installed, the packages you need for an analysis are loaded by the library('package_name') function. The following packages are commonly used by UCSB for fisheries analyses: tidyverse - Contains numerous seperate packages for loading and writing data files (readr), data processing (dplyr &amp; tidyr), plotting (ggplot2), and functional programming (purrr) readxl - Reads and writes data from/to Excel workbooks, including workbooks with multiple worksheets lubridate - Helps R handle dates in an efficient and easy-to-understand manner sf, rgeos, rgdal - Key packages for spatial analyses similar to those done with ArcGIS rmarkdown - Uses R code to author reproducible reports, presentations, and websites shiny - Creates web applications using R 3.4 Helpful Resources Jenny Bryan’s Guide to Installing R and RStudio "],
["data-entry-management.html", "4 Data Entry &amp; Management 4.1 Best Practices 4.2 Helpful Resources", " 4 Data Entry &amp; Management The careful entry, documentation, and management of data is essential to any data-related project. Being strategic about this process will keep the project organized, protect against data loss, and facilitate analysis and data sharing. 4.1 Best Practices Using “flat” files and an open data format Raw data should be entered as a “flat” table and saved using an open data format, such as .csv (comma separated values). “Flat” data files are tables where the first “header” row contains the variables in the data set and there is no internal hierarchy to the data. Nested columns and rows make analysis of the raw data outside of the original file very difficult. Organize data in a tidy format with unique records in rows, not columns Data records should be stored in rows (long-format) instead of columns (wide format). This allows analysis within rows rather than across columns. This “tidy data” format means that each variable is saved in its own column and each observation is saved in its own row. Describe data in a metadata file Your raw flat data files should only include data, no comments. Rather than using complicated spreadsheets, create a metadata document, often called “README”, that includes (at a minimum) what data you are collecting, how and when the data were collected, where the data is stored, and who owns the data. This file should also include a “data dictionary” that describes each variable and associated unit in the data file (see example below). Be as specific as possible; for example, the description for fish length variables should include whether it is fork length, total length, or standard length. Use clear and concise descriptive names for data files and variable names File names are the easiest way to explain the contents of a data file. Capturing the place, time, and content of the data, even in an abbreviated fashion, can be extremely useful. For example, consider naming a fish catch monitoring file “muni_fishcatch_month_year.csv”, replacing “muni”, “month”, and “year” with the appropriate values. Similarly, each column in your data should contain a unique variable and be given a clear but concise name that uses letters, numbers, dashes, dots, or underscores. Lastly, always use plain ASCII text, as certain marks (e.g., accents) or characters (e.g., Chinese or Japanese) are not widely supported. File and variable names should NOT be overly long or contain spaces or special characters (e.g. *&amp;$%@/) YES: filename: muni_fishcatch_month_year.csv | variables: year; first_name; last.name; TotalLength NO: filename: November 2007.csv | variables: Start Year; First Name; Total weight (kg); $ Value Always use consistent formats for data values and (if necessary) put units in a separate column When entering data, do not mix text and numeric responses, or include both text and numbers in the same response. Periods are okay to include for numeric responses but avoid commas (commas indicate a new value in a .csv file). For text values, such as a person’s name or location, take care not to change capitalization, spelling, spacing, etc. (e.g. John, john, jon) as this will generate confusion. Consider using identification codes for variables with many possible categories (e.g., local species name, gear type). Units should always be in their own column or absent entirely but explained in the metadata file. Also, do not use color coding, it cannot be interpreted by other software (data in red below are just to demonstrate improper data entries). Use standardized formats for dates When reporting full dates, use standardized formats since date representations vary between the United States and the rest of the world. For example, 01-09-17 will likely be interpreted as January 9th, 2017 in the U.S. but September 1st, 2017 or September 17th, 2001 in other countries. Therefore, always record dates using the international standard of YYYY-MM-DD as prescribed by the International Organization of Standards (ISO) standard ISO 8601 (2004). It is also generally good to have separate columns for month and year to facilitate analyses that are only interested in certain months or years (e.g. what are the average landings in March?). Always store an uncorrected original version of the data file and BACK UP YOUR DATA!!! When you make changes or corrections to the original data file you could easily make a mistake. To avoid compromising your original raw data, always store an unadjusted copy of the data file and do not make any changes or adjustments to this copy (make it “read-only” if possible). Make a duplicate file if corrections or adjustments are required and be sure to describe what changes were made in the metadata file. Lastly, ALWAYS BACK UP YOUR DATA by keeping at least three copies of the file in different locations (e.g., desktop, external hard drive, the cloud). Be consistent with blank cells by using NA It is common for cells to be blank in a spreadsheet. However, there are many different ways to signify a blank cell, some of which are more difficult to work with. We recommend always using NA in any blank cell, rather than simply leaving the cell blank, putting in spaces, or other options like NaN or -999. This will allow R to quickly identify and deal with empty cells. For storing data, always use CSV files instead of XLS or XLSX files There are also several different file formats for storing spreadsheet data. XLS and XLSX are two very commonly used formats, and are the standard Microsoft Excel spreadsheet format (XLSX is the newest version). However, many programming languages have difficulty ingesting Microsoft Excel files. These files also require people using them to have a copy of Microsoft Excel, which not everyone has and can be expensive. We therefore recommend using the CSV file format for storing data. CSV stands for “Comma-Separated Values” and describes how data are stored in the file. If you have a Microsoft Excel file, you can save it as a CSV by clicking File -&gt; Save As and selecting the CSV option. CSVs can be read directly into R, and used and manipulated by anyone with a computer. 4.2 Helpful Resources https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/files/news/ESAdatamng09.pdf http://ucsd.libguides.com/c.php?g=90957&amp;p=585435 "],
["r-as-a-programming-language.html", "5 R as a Programming Language 5.1 Data frames 5.2 Vectors 5.3 Functions 5.4 Tips on coding and style 5.5 Helpful resources", " 5 R as a Programming Language You may or may not have used other programming languages before coming to R. Either way, R has several distinctive features which are worth noting. 5.1 Data frames One of R’s greatest strengths is in manipulating data. One of the primary structures for storing data in R is called a Data Frame. Much of your work in R will be working with and manipulating data frames. Data frames are made up of rows and columns. The top row is a header and describes the contents of each column. Each row represents an individual data row or observation. Rows can also have names. Each row contains multiple cells which contain the content of the data. Let’s look at a data frame that is included in R as an example. This data frame is called mtcars and contains some data about common car models. We can look at this data frame using the head function, which previews the first few rows. You can also use the functions colnames or rownames to get the column or row names of a data frame, respecitvely. head(mtcars) ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 ## Valiant 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 The columns in data frames can contain different types of information. In this particular data frame, all columns contain numbers, as denoted by the indication &lt;dbl&gt;, a type of number that allows numbers after the decimal point. Columns could also be integers (which don’t allow numbers after the decimal point), booleans or logicals (TRUE or FALSE), characters (these contain text), or other types of data. These days, you may also see the word tibble, which is a modern version of the R data frame and is being used more and more widely. Tibbles generally function much like data frames, but do away with some frustrating features. 5.2 Vectors Another very common data type is the vector, which stores 1-dimensional information, such as a list of numbers or characters. Vectors are built using the c function. Below are two examples: myNumericVector &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4) myCharacterVector &lt;- c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;) 5.3 Functions R is a “functional” programming language, which means it gets much of its power by relying on the concept of functions. Functions are small chunks of code that can do a certain task. They require a certain number of inputs, and provide a certain number of outputs. They allow for common tasks to be performed easily and reproducibly. R contains many built-in functions, including several for helpful statistics, as shown below. In these examples, there are also some helpful comments to tell you what each line is doing in the code blocks below. Comments start with the # operation, and are not evaluated by R - they are simply there to document the code. # The sum function takes a vector of numbers as an input, calculates the sum of those numbers, and produces a single number as an output sum(c(1, 2, 3)) ## [1] 6 # The mean function takes a vector of numbers as an input, calculates the mean of those numbers, and produces a single number as an mean(c(1 ,2, 3)) ## [1] 2 # The median function takes a vector of numbers as an input, calculates the median of those numbers, and produces a single number as an median(c(1 ,2, 3)) ## [1] 2 You can even define your own functions, which can be an incredibly powerful way to save time when doing a task you anticipate needing to do many times. The example below shows how you would write a function that takes in two numbers as an input, manipulates the numbers, and then provides a single number as an output. Once you have defined a function, you can use it again later on. # Define the function myFunction &lt;- function(x,y){ z &lt;- (x + 2 * y) / x return(z) } # Test the function myFunction(3,4) ## [1] 3.666667 5.4 Tips on coding and style It is helpful to code in a consistent manner. This will not only make your code readble by others, but will even be helpful for you as you revisit code you have previously written. Using consistent code stying also makes it much easier to collaborate with others. We highly recommend following Google’s style guidelines for R. 5.5 Helpful resources More information on data frames More information on tibbles, the modern version of data frames Functions Google’s style guidelines "],
["packages-1.html", "6 Packages", " 6 Packages The first step in any analysis is to load the packages you will need for your analysis. Loading packages allows you to use powerful functions not included in “base” R. For this analysis, you will use the tidyverse package, which actually loads a group of useful packages including tidyr, dplyr, readr, and ggplot2. tidyr and dplyr are very handy packages for manipulating data, readr is great for loading in data such as csv files, while ggplot2 is one of the best packages from plotting data. lubridate is another very handy package for dealing with dates and times. If you haven’t done so yet, follow the instructions in the Installation section to load the tidyverse and lubridate packages which will be used in the example. You can then type the following lines into the console to load them into your current R session. library(tidyverse) library(lubridate) The next few sections of this quick introduction to R will walk you through how to calculate some basic fisheries statistics and plot the results.

["loading-fisheries-data.html", "7 Loading Fisheries Data", " 7 Loading Fisheries Data Next, you’ll load the data you’ll be using for the analysis using the read_csv function. First, create a new folder in your working directory called “_data“. Next, download the following two files onto your computer. Right click on each link, and save it in your”_data&quot; folder. Right click and save-link-as to download landings data Right click and save-link-as to download life history data Next, you’ll load these two csv files into R. First load the landings data which includes catch, effort, and length measurements and store these data to a data frame called landings_data. Next, load the life history parameter data file and store these data to a data frame called life_history_parameters. landings_data &lt;- read_csv(&quot;_data/sample_landings_data.csv&quot;) life_history_parameters &lt;- read_csv(&quot;_data/life_history_parameters.csv&quot;) Let’s take a quick look at what’s in each of these data frames. We can use the head function to get a quick summary. head(landings_data) ## # A tibble: 6 × 8 ## Year Date Trip_ID Effort_Hours Gear Species Length_cm ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2003 4/30/03 1 10 Trap Caesio cuning 36 ## 2 2003 4/30/03 1 10 Trap Caesio cuning 29 ## 3 2003 4/30/03 1 10 Trap Caesio cuning 34 ## 4 2003 4/30/03 1 10 Trap Caesio cuning 36 ## 5 2003 4/30/03 1 10 Trap Caesio cuning 34 ## 6 2003 4/30/03 1 10 Trap Caesio cuning 28 ## # ... with 1 more variables: Weight_g &lt;dbl&gt; The landings_data data frame is from a fishery-dependent landing site survey. The species included in this data set is Caesio cuning, a yellowtail fusilier. You can see the data frame has eight columns, with each row being an individual fish catch measurement. The columns include the year and date when the measurement was collected, the fishing trip ID, how many hours were fished for each trip, what gear was used, the species, the length of the fish, and the weight of the fish. We’ll be able to use these data to create length-frequency histograms that describe the size structure of the population, as well as trends in catch and CPUE. One thing we should do is format the year and date columns to ensure that R knows these represent years and dates as we humans think of them. We can use the mdy and year functions from the lubridate package to do this, combined with the mutate function from the dplyr package. We start by taking the landings data frame we loaded into R, and working through a series of “pipes”, designated by the %&gt;% operation, which progressively analyzes the data from one step to the next. Essentially, the output of one line is fed into the input of the next line. # Start with the landings data frame landings_data &lt;- landings_data %&gt;% # Turn the date column into a date format that R recognizes mutate(Date = mdy(Date)) %&gt;% # Create a year column using a year format R recognizes mutate(Year = year(Date)) One of the first things you should always do is quickly plot your raw data using ggplot. This can help you familiarize yourself with what’s contained in the data set, as well as look for any potential outliers or errors. We will come back to a more detailed description of plots and visualizations later, but below is some quick code to look at things. When using ggplot, first start with your data frame and initialize the ggplot by specifying the plot’s aesthetics (variables) using aes(). Then use the + operation to add at least one geometry (type of plot, such as a scatter plot) and any additional features to the plot. To learn more about ggplot, the Data Visualization with ggplot2 Cheat Sheet is a very helpful resource, as is this ggplot cookbook. The first figure just shows a point for every weight measurement over time. # Start with the landings data frame landings_data %&gt;% # Initialize a ggplot of weight measurements versus year ggplot(aes(x=Date,y=Weight_g)) + # Tell ggplot that the plot type should be a scatter plot geom_point() The second figure shows a histogram of the length data. # Start with the landings data frame landings_data %&gt;% # Initialize ggplot of data using the length column ggplot(aes(Length_cm)) + # Tell ggplot that the plot type should be a histogram geom_histogram() Let’s next look at the life_history_parameters data frame. head(life_history_parameters) ## # A tibble: 1 × 11 ## Species Common L_inf k t0 M Wa ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Caesio cuning Yellowtail fusilier 62.2 0.32 -0.42 0.8915981 0.0208 ## # ... with 4 more variables: Wb &lt;dbl&gt;, m50 &lt;dbl&gt;, m95 &lt;dbl&gt;, maxAge &lt;int&gt; The life_history_parameters data frame includes several important life history parameters that were found doing a literature review of this species. L_infinity, k, and t0 describe the age-to-length relationship using the von Bertalanffy growth equation. M represents natural mortality. Wa and Wb describe the length-to-weight relationship. m50 and m95 describe the lengths at which 50% and 95% of the fish are mature, respectively. maxAge is the maximum age of the fish. "],

To calculate annual landings, take your landings_data data frame, add a column for weight of individual fish in kilograms by using the mutate function, group the data by year by using the group_by function, and then summarize the data for each year by summing the total weight of all fish caught in each year using the summarize and sum functions. # Start with the landings data frame annual_landings &lt;- landings_data %&gt;% # Add colomn for kilograms by dividing gram column by 1000 mutate(Weight_kg = Weight_g / 1000) %&gt;% # Group the data by year group_by(Year) %&gt;% # Next, summarize the total annual landings per year summarize(Annual_Landings_kg = sum(Weight_kg,na.rm=TRUE)) ## Display a table of the annual landings data annual_landings ## # A tibble: 9 × 2 ## Year Annual_Landings_kg ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2003 311.04137 ## 2 2004 565.49423 ## 3 2005 163.24191 ## 4 2006 37.11914 ## 5 2010 131.84178 ## 6 2011 156.77825 ## 7 2012 101.53198 ## 8 2013 579.52008 ## 9 2014 1278.52662 Note the use of na.rm = TRUE in the code above. This is an important argument of many R functions (sum() in this case) and it tells R what to do with NA values in your data. Here, we are telling R to first remove NA values before calculating the sum of the Weight_kg variable. By default, many functions will return NA if any value is NA, which is often not desirable. You may be interested in looking at landings across different gear types. Here, we now group the data frame by both the year and the gear type in order to summarize the total landings by year and by gear. # Start with the landings data frame annual_gear_landings &lt;- landings_data %&gt;% # Add colomn for kilograms by dividing gram column by 1000 mutate(Weight_kg = Weight_g / 1000) %&gt;% # Group the data by year and gear type group_by(Year,Gear) %&gt;% # Next, summarize the total annual landings per year and gear type summarize(Annual_Landings_kg = sum(Weight_kg,na.rm=TRUE)) ## Display a table of the annual landings data by gear type annual_gear_landings ## Source: local data frame [39 x 3] ## Groups: Year [?] ## ## Year Gear Annual_Landings_kg ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2003 Gillnet 13.413401 ## 2 2003 Handline 3.188572 ## 3 2003 Muroami 247.879049 ## 4 2003 Trap 46.560347 ## 5 2004 Gillnet 4.189301 ## 6 2004 Handline 57.705893 ## 7 2004 Muroami 370.866460 ## 8 2004 Speargun 9.476406 ## 9 2004 Trap 118.869619 ## 10 2004 Trolling 4.386547 ## # ... with 29 more rows 8.2 Calculating Catch-per-Unit-Effort (CPUE) You may also be interested in calculating catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE). CPUE is calculated by dividing the catch of each fishing trip by the number of hours fished during that trip. This gives CPUE in units of kilograms per hour. The median for every year is then calculated in order to remove outliers - some fishers are much more efficient than others. # Start with the landings data frame cpue_data &lt;- landings_data %&gt;% # Add colomn for kilograms by dividing gram column by 1000 mutate(Weight_kg = Weight_g / 1000) %&gt;% # Group by year and Trip ID so that you can calculate CPUE for every trip in every year group_by(Year,Trip_ID) %&gt;% # For each year and trip ID, calculate the CPUE for each trip by dividing the sum of the catch, converted from grams to kilograms, by the trip by the number of fishing hours summarize(Trip_CPUE = sum(Weight_kg) / mean(Effort_Hours)) %&gt;% # Next, just group by year so we can calculate median CPUE for each year across all trips in the year group_by(Year) %&gt;% # Calculate median CPUE for each year summarize(Median_CPUE_kg_hour = median(Trip_CPUE)) # Display a table of the CPUE data cpue_data ## # A tibble: 9 × 2 ## Year Median_CPUE_kg_hour ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2003 0.31834277 ## 2 2004 0.26070028 ## 3 2005 0.40145105 ## 4 2006 0.44029501 ## 5 2010 0.01742840 ## 6 2011 0.03123217 ## 7 2012 0.03123217 ## 8 2013 0.19638408 ## 9 2014 0.88216281 8.3 Calculating Percent Mature You may also wish to analyze your length data. One analysis would be to determine the percentage of mature fish in the catch in every year of the data frame. To do this, we add a column to the data frame using the mutate function that represents whether each fish is mature or not (represented by a TRUE or FALSE), group the data frame by year, and then summarize for each year the percentage of mature fish out of the total number of sampled fish. To determine if a fish is mature or not, it is compared against m95, the length at which 95% of fish are mature. The value for m95 is taken from the life_history_parameters data frame and is referenced using a $ and the code life_history_parameters$m95. # Start with the landings data frame landings_data %&gt;% # Add a column to the data that indicates whether each length measurement is from a mature or immature fish. If it&#39;s mature, this value should be TRUE; if immature, FALSE. mutate(Mature = Length_cm &gt; life_history_parameters$m95) %&gt;% # Group by year so we can see the percent mature for every year group_by(Year) %&gt;% # The percentage mature is equal to the number of mature fish divided by the total number of fish and multiplied by 100 summarize(Percent_Mature = sum(Mature) / n() * 100) ## # A tibble: 9 × 2 ## Year Percent_Mature ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2003 98.57595 ## 2 2004 98.62306 ## 3 2005 97.73371 ## 4 2006 100.00000 ## 5 2010 91.80556 ## 6 2011 99.77629 ## 7 2012 99.65398 ## 8 2013 99.46164 ## 9 2014 99.55709 Over 90% of the fish are mature throughout the time series, which is a great sign! 8.4 Helpful Resources Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr Cheat Sheet is a very helpful resource for learning how to “wrangle” (manipulate) data in R "],
["plotting-fisheries-data.html", "9 Plotting Fisheries Data 9.1 Plotting Landings 9.2 Plotting CPUE 9.3 Plotting Length Frequency 9.4 Helpful Resources", " 9 Plotting Fisheries Data This document will now walk you through how to make make some basic fisheries plots using the data frames you created in the previous analysis section and the ggplot plotting function. When using ggplot, first start with your data frame and initialize the ggplot by specifying the plot’s aesthetics (variables) using aes(). Then use the + operation to add at least one geometry (type of plot, such as a scatter plot) and any additional features to the plot. To learn more about ggplot, the Data Visualization with ggplot2 Cheat Sheet is a very helpful resource, as is this ggplot cookbook. 9.1 Plotting Landings Let’s plot a time series of annual landings data. We start with the annual landings data we made in the previous step, and then feed this into a ggplot. # Start with the annual_landings data frame you created in the last step annual_landings %&gt;% # Initialize a ggplot of annual landings versus year ggplot(aes(x=Year,y=Annual_Landings_kg)) + # Tell ggplot that the plot type should be a scatter plot geom_point() + # Also add a line connecting the points geom_line() + # Change the y-axis title ylab(&quot;Annual Landings [kg/year]&quot;) + # Add figure title ggtitle(&quot;Annual landings of Caesio cuning&quot;) In this example, we are using aes(x=Year, y=Annual_Landings_kg) to specify that the we want to plot years on the x-axis and annual landings on the y-axis. We then want to visualize these variables with both a scatter plot (geom_point()) and a line plot (geom_line()) geometry. It appears landings were going down between 2004 and 2011, but have been increasing since then. Again, you may be interested in looking across different gear types. To plot, we use ggplot’s faceting functionality, which tells ggplot to divide up the data by a certain variable, Gear in this case, and make multiple similar plots. You can use the facet_wrap() function to accomplish this. # Start with the landings data frame annual_gear_landings %&gt;% # First, group the data by year group_by(Year,Gear) %&gt;% # Initialize a ggplot of annual landings versus year ggplot(aes(x=Year,y=Annual_Landings_kg)) + # Tell ggplot that the plot type should be a scatter plot geom_point() + # Also add a line connecting the points geom_line() + # Change the y-axis title ylab(&quot;Normalized annual Landings [kg/year]&quot;) + # Add figure title ggtitle(&quot;Normalized annual landings of Caesio cuning&quot;) + # This tells the figure to plot by all different gear types facet_wrap(~Gear) It now becomes clear that the recent increase in catch seems to be concentrated in speargun and trap fishing. Meanwhile, catch from muroami, a very destructive type of gear where nets are driven into the reef, has dropped to 0 since a ban of that gear in 2012 - a good sign that management regulation is working. 9.2 Plotting CPUE You may also be interested in plotting median catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE). You take your CPUE data frame made in the last step and feed it into ggplot. # Start with the CPUE data frame cpue_data %&gt;% # Initialize a ggplot of median CPUE versus year ggplot(aes(x=Year,y=Median_CPUE_kg_hour)) + # Tell ggplot that the plot type should be a scatter plot geom_point() + # Also add a line connecting the points geom_line() + # Change the y-axis title ylab(&quot;Median CPUE [kg/hour]&quot;) + # Add figure title ggtitle(&quot;Median CPUE for Caesio cuning&quot;) CPUE appears to have increased significantly during the last years. This may be due to increasing abundance in the water, which would be a good thing, but may also be indicative of increased gear efficiency coinciding with the transition to traps and spearguns, which may be concerning. 9.3 Plotting Length Frequency Finally, let’s first look at the length data from the catch, which gives an indication of the size structure and health of the population. Let’s look at the length data for 2014, which is the most recent year of data available. We first filter the data to be only from 2014 using the filter() function. We then create a histogram of the length data, which shows how many individuals of each size class were measured in the catch. On the histogram, we’ll also add a vertical line to show the length at which fish mature to get a sense of how sustainable the catch is - the catch should be composed mostly of mature fish. This information comes from the life history parameter data input file. # Start with the landings data frame landings_data %&gt;% # Filter data to only look at length measurements from 2014 filter(Year == 2014) %&gt;% # Initialize ggplot of data using the length column ggplot(aes(Length_cm)) + # Tell ggplot that the plot type should be a histogram geom_histogram() + # Change x-axis label xlab(&quot;Length [cm]&quot;) + # Add figure title ggtitle(&quot;Length histogram of Caesio cuning in the catch\\nLength at 95% maturity shown as a red line.&quot;) + # Add a red vertical line for m95, the length at which 95% of fish are mature. Any fish below this length may be immature. Use the life_history_parameter data frame to get this value. geom_vline(aes(xintercept=life_history_parameters$m95),color=&quot;red&quot;) You might also be interested in seeing how the size composition varies by gear type. You can recreate the figure above, but separate the histograms out by gear type using ggplot’s “facet” function. # Start with the landings data frame landings_data %&gt;% # Filter data to only look at length measurements from 2014 filter(Year == 2014) %&gt;% # Initialize ggplot of data using the length column ggplot(aes(Length_cm)) + # Tell ggplot that the plot type should be a histogram geom_histogram() + # Change x-axis label xlab(&quot;Length [cm]&quot;) + # Add figure title ggtitle(&quot;Length histogram of Caesio cuning in the catch by gear type\\nLength at 95% maturity shown as a red line.&quot;) + # Add a red line form95, the length at which 95% of fish are mature. Any fish below this length may be immature. Use the life_history_parameter data frame to get this value. geom_vline(aes(xintercept=life_history_parameters$m95),color=&quot;red&quot;) + # This tells the figure to plot by all different gear types, known as facetting facet_wrap(~Gear) It appears as if the size structure is about the same from each gear, although by far the most amount of fish are caught using speargun. Very few fish are caught using trolling. These plots indicate a generally increasing catch, CPUE, and a healthy size structure. Our results demonstrate that the population is likely doing fairly well, and may be recovering since the 2012 ban of muroami fishing gear. 9.4 Helpful Resources Data Visualization with ggplot2 Cheat Sheet ggplot cookbook "],
["wrapping-up.html", "10 Wrapping Up 10.1 R Packages for Fishery Analysis 10.2 Additional Resources", " 10 Wrapping Up Congratulations! You’ve completed our introduction to R and are ready to start using it to conduct fishery analyses. We think you’ll find, like us, that R will dramatically expand your ability to ask interesting and important questions about your data. Furthermore, by doing all your data processing, analysis, and plotting in R you can develop a streamlined work flow that is entirely reproducible and does not jeopardize the integrity of your raw data. R is a very powerful and flexible tool. Once you become comfortable with the types of analyses outlined in this tutorial you can start using R to run fishery models or build your own. 10.1 R Packages for Fishery Analysis Fortunately, there are already numerous R packages available that are specifically designed for different types of fisheries analyses. The following four packages all contain very useful functions, and numerous other packages are available. Before jumping into these packages, however, we recommend you become familiar with R and more basic analyses first. Also, keep in mind that R is an open-source language, which means that anyone can submit packages. You should therefore always be sure to read the package documentation and double check your work to be sure things are performing as expected. TropFishR - Fish stock assessment methods and fisheries models based on the FAO Manual “Introduction to tropical fish stock assessment” by P. Sparre and S.C. Venema. Focus is the analysis of length-frequency data and data-poor fisheries. DLMTool - Implementation of management procedures for data-limited fisheries LBSPR - Functions to run the Length-Based Spawning Potential Ratio (LBSPR) method. The LBSPR package can be used in two ways: 1) simulating the expected length composition, growth curve, and SPR and yield curves using the LBSPR model and 2) fitting to empirical length data to provide an estimate of the spawning potential ratio (SPR). fishmethods - Fishery science methods and models from published literature All four of these packages are available on CRAN and can be downloaded directly in RStudio by running the following command: install.packages(c(&#39;TropFishR&#39;,&#39;DLMTool&#39;, &#39;LBSPR&#39;, &#39;fishmethods&#39;)) 10.2 Additional Resources Throughout this guidebook we provided links to additional useful R resources.
